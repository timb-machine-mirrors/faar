\cf11                    organizations.\cf2 \
\cf11    To \'93modify\'94     a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring \cf2 \
\cf11                    copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work \cf2 \
\cf11                    is called a \'93modified version\'94 of the earlier work or a work \'93based on\'94 the earlier \cf2 \
\cf11                    work.  A \'93covered work\'94 means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the \cf2 \
\cf11                    Program.\cf2 \
\cf11    To \'93propagate\'94  a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly \cf2 \

\cf11                    executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, \cf2 \
\cf11                    distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and \cf2 \
\cf11                    in some countries other activities as well.\cf2 \
\cf11    To \'93convey\'94     a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive \cf2 \
\cf11                    copies.  Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer \cf2 \
\cf11                    of a copy, is not conveying.\cf2 \
\
\cf11    An interactive user interface displays \'93Appropriate Legal Notices\'94 to the extent that it includes \cf2 \
\cf11    a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, \cf2 \
\cf11    and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties \cf2 \
\cf11    are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License herin. If the interface \cf2 \
\cf11    presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets \cf2 \
\cf11    this criterion.\cf2 \
